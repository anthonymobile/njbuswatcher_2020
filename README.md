# NJ BusWatcher
**3 june 2019**

### Version 2

Improvements over v1
- rewritten in Python 3
- new localization and stop assignment algorithm is based on geographicposition and stop proximity not API arrival predictions
- full SQLalchemy database implementation for easier mix and match backend


### Overview

Buswatcher is a Python web app to collect bus position and stop arrival prediction data from several API endpoints maintained by NJTransit (via vendor Clever Devices), synthesize and summarize this information, and present to riders in a number of useful ways via a simple, interactive web application. Its implemented in Python using flask, pandas, and geopandas.

Check out a live version focusing on Jersey City  [buswatcher.code4jc.org](http://buswatcher.code4jc.org)

### Installation

It's all dockerized now. Use `docker-compose` and build from the project root.

#### Manual MySQL Database Creation

(for testing)

```
sudo mysql -u root -p
mysql> CREATE USER 'buswatcher'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'njtransit';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON buses . * TO 'buswatcher'@'localhost';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> ALTER USER 'buswatcher'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'njtransit';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> flush privileges;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
```

### Components

- **tripwatcher.py**. Fetches bus current locations for a route from the NJT API, creates a `Trip` instance for each, and populates it with `ScheduledStop` instances for each stop on the service its running, and a `BusPosition` instance for each observed position.
- **reportcard.py** The flask app for routing incoming requests.
- **/lib** Core classes.
    - **DataBases.py**
        - *`Trip` Class*. The basis for all route performance metrics are Trips, represented in buswatcher by the `Trip` class. `Trip` instances are created by `tripwatcher.py` as needed to hold `BusPosition` instances (`BusPosition` is an inner class of `Trip`. `TripDB` instances handle writing to the database.
        
### API 

The API is a work in progress, but we will try to keep it robust and exposing all of the internal data used in the web app.

### endpoint: /api/v1/positions

We have a simple API set up with one endpoint for the bus positions data -- this is currently not used by the web app but will be once the new Localizer is done.

Usage with arguments
```
http://buswatcher.code4jc.org/api/v1/positions?rt=119&period=weekly
```

#### required arguments
`rt`    NJ transit route number (e.g. 119)
#### optional arguments
`period`  How much data to grab ('daily'=today, 'yesterday', 'weekly'=week to date,'history'=all time(default)) -- n.b. soon we'll add ability to query on specific dates in 'yyyy-mm-dd' format

`pd` Destination name (be careful will need an exact match)

`fs` Headsign display text

`dn` Compass direction of vehicle travel

`bid` Vehicle (e.g. bus) id, useful if you want to track a particular journey

`run` A specific scheduled trip (which ought to be but is not the GTFS trip_id which drives me bananas.) Actually better for tracking a journey, as you can compare between days and over periods even if the equipment changes.

`op` Probably operator(driver) id number.

`pid` Unknown purpose. But possibly a service identfier (e.g. direction or local/express or branch or some combination).

`dip` Unknown purpose.

`id` Unknown purpose.



#### response format

Reponses are geoJSON. Here's a typical record.
```
    {
      "geometry": {
        "coordinates": [
          -74.138438, 
          40.647728
        ], 
        "type": "Point"
      }, 
      "properties": {
        "bid": "8272", 
        "dip": "72242", 
        "dn": "SW", 
        "fs": "119 JERSEY CITY VIA CENTRAL BAYOONNE VIA JFK BLVD", 
        "id": "6053", 
        "op": "1031", 
        "pd": "Bayonne", 
        "pid": "1860", 
        "run": "916", 
        "timestamp": "Thu, 04 Oct 2018 20:10:01 GMT"
      }, 
      "type": "Feature"
    }, 

```

### endpoint: /api/v1/arrivals

This endpoint exposes the predictions about when buses running on a specific route will arrive at specific stops. This data is drawn off the NJT API and is the heart of how we currently log when buses call at stops. (This will be depreceated when the Localizer is done and we do it basedon actual observed bus locations.)

Usage with arguments
```
http://buswatcher.code4jc.org/api/v1/arrivals?rt=119&stop_id=30189&period=weekly
```

#### required arguments
`rt`    NJ transit route number (e.g. 119)

`stop_id`   NJ transit stop number (e.g. 30189)

#### optional arguments

Any of the fields in the JSON response below may be used as arguments. You'll get an error if you use an invalid query.

#### response format

Reponses are geoJSON. Here's a typical record.
```
    "{"pkey":28831,
    "pt":"APPROACHING",
    "rd":"87",
    "stop_id":"21062",
    "stop_name":"PALISADE AVE + SOUTH ST",
    "v":"5737",
    "timestamp":1540903024000,
    "delta":599000},
```
